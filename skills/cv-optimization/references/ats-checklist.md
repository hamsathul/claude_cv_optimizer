# ATS Compatibility Checklist

Run through each item before finalizing the optimized CV. ATS failures mean the CV never reaches a human.

## File Format & Structure

- [ ] Use standard section headings (e.g., "Work Experience" not "Where I've Made My Mark")
- [ ] No text boxes, tables, or multi-column layouts in the main body (ATS reads left-to-right, top-to-bottom)
- [ ] No headers or footers for critical information (some ATS ignore these)
- [ ] No images, graphics, charts, or icons embedded in the document
- [ ] No watermarks or background images
- [ ] Use standard fonts: Arial, Calibri, Cambria, Garamond, Georgia, Helvetica, Times New Roman
- [ ] Font size between 10pt and 12pt for body text, up to 14pt for headings
- [ ] Single-column layout preferred
- [ ] Standard bullet characters (•, –, or *), no custom symbols or emoji
- [ ] File saved as .docx (most ATS-compatible) or .pdf (if specifically requested, ensure it's text-based, not image-based)

## Content Formatting

- [ ] Dates use consistent format throughout (e.g., "Jan 2020 – Mar 2023" or "01/2020 – 03/2023")
- [ ] Job titles, company names, and dates are on separate lines or clearly delimited
- [ ] No abbreviations without the full term also appearing (e.g., write "Search Engine Optimization (SEO)" not just "SEO")
- [ ] Contact information is in plain text, not inside a table or text box
- [ ] Email and phone are in standard formats (ATS auto-detects these)
- [ ] No special characters that might corrupt (curly quotes, em dashes from word processors are usually fine)
- [ ] Section headings use standard heading styles (Heading 1 or Heading 2 in Word) rather than just bold text

## Keyword Optimization

- [ ] Keywords from the JD appear naturally in context, not stuffed into a hidden block
- [ ] Both the acronym and full term appear for technical skills (e.g., "Machine Learning (ML)")
- [ ] Job title variations are included if they match the user's actual title (e.g., "Software Engineer / Software Developer")
- [ ] Hard skills from the JD appear in both the Skills section AND within work experience bullets
- [ ] Industry-specific terminology matches JD language exactly
- [ ] No keyword stuffing in white/invisible text (this gets flagged and rejected)

## Length & Density

- [ ] 1 page for early career (0-5 years), 2 pages for mid-senior (5-15 years), up to 3 pages for executive/academic
- [ ] No large blank spaces or excessive whitespace
- [ ] Margins between 0.5" and 1" on all sides
- [ ] Dense enough to demonstrate depth, but not so crowded that readability suffers

## Common ATS Parsing Failures to Avoid

- Fancy dividers or horizontal lines (use heading styles instead)
- Infographics or skill bars (replace with plain text lists)
- Creative layouts with sidebars (use single-column)
- Company logos or personal photos
- Non-standard section ordering (Summary → Experience → Skills → Education is safest)
- PDF files created from images or scans (must be text-selectable)
- Merged cells in tables
- Text rotated or placed at angles

## Final Verification

After generating the output document:

- [ ] Open the document and verify all text is selectable (not an image)
- [ ] Verify section headings are parsed as headings (not just large bold text)
- [ ] Confirm bullet points render correctly
- [ ] Check that no formatting artifacts appear (broken tables, misaligned text)
- [ ] Verify the document opens without errors in Microsoft Word
