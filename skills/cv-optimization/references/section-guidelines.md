# Section-by-Section Optimization Guidelines

Detailed rules for optimizing each CV section against a target job description.

## Contact Information / Header

- Full name in a larger, clear font
- Professional email address (no nicknames or unprofessional handles)
- Phone number with country code if applying internationally
- LinkedIn URL (shortened/customized if possible)
- City and country only (full address is unnecessary and a privacy risk)
- Portfolio or personal website if relevant to the role
- Do NOT include: photo, date of birth, marital status, nationality (unless legally required in the target country)
- Keep formatting simple — no text boxes, tables, or columns for this section (ATS may misparse)

## Professional Summary

This is the most impactful section for both ATS and human readers. Optimize heavily.

- 3-5 sentences maximum
- Lead with years of experience + professional identity aligned to the JD title
  - Example: "Senior Software Engineer with 8+ years of experience in..." not "Experienced professional seeking..."
- Incorporate 3-5 of the highest-priority keywords from the JD naturally
- Mention the specific domain/industry if it matches the JD
- Include one quantified achievement that directly relates to the role
- End with what the candidate brings to the role (value proposition)
- Never use first person ("I", "my") — use implied first person
- Never use the word "objective" — use "summary" or "profile"

**Pattern**: [Title] with [X years] of experience in [domain]. Proven track record of [achievement with metric] in [relevant context]. Expertise in [key skill 1], [key skill 2], and [key skill 3]. [Value proposition for this role].

## Work Experience

The core of the CV. Each role should demonstrate alignment with the target JD.

### Role Headers
- Job title (bolded)
- Company name
- Location (city, country)
- Date range (Month Year – Month Year or "Present")
- Use consistent date formatting throughout

### Bullet Points
- 4-6 bullets per recent role, 2-3 for older roles
- Lead with a strong action verb (different verb for each bullet)
- Follow the CAR format: Challenge → Action → Result
- Quantify results wherever possible:
  - Revenue/cost: "Reduced operational costs by $2.3M annually"
  - Scale: "Managed team of 15 engineers across 3 time zones"
  - Performance: "Improved API response time by 40%"
  - Growth: "Grew user base from 10K to 150K in 12 months"
- Mirror JD language naturally:
  - If JD says "stakeholder management" and CV says "worked with clients" → change to "managed stakeholder relationships"
  - If JD says "Agile methodology" and CV says "sprint-based work" → change to "Agile methodology"
- Prioritize bullets: most relevant to the JD first
- Remove bullets that add no value for the target role (e.g., administrative duties when applying for a technical role)

### Strong Action Verbs by Category
- **Leadership**: Directed, Led, Orchestrated, Spearheaded, Championed, Oversaw
- **Achievement**: Delivered, Achieved, Exceeded, Surpassed, Attained, Accomplished
- **Technical**: Engineered, Architected, Developed, Implemented, Automated, Integrated
- **Improvement**: Optimized, Streamlined, Enhanced, Accelerated, Modernized, Transformed
- **Analysis**: Analyzed, Evaluated, Assessed, Identified, Diagnosed, Investigated
- **Communication**: Presented, Negotiated, Collaborated, Facilitated, Articulated, Conveyed
- **Creation**: Designed, Established, Launched, Pioneered, Initiated, Founded

## Skills Section

- Organize into clear categories: Technical Skills, Tools & Platforms, Methodologies, Languages, etc.
- List skills that appear in the JD first within each category
- Use the exact skill names from the JD (e.g., "Amazon Web Services (AWS)" not just "cloud")
- Include both the spelled-out version and acronym for technical terms
- Remove skills irrelevant to the target role unless they show breadth
- Do NOT rate skills with bars, stars, or percentages — ATS cannot parse these and they invite bias
- Use a simple comma-separated or line-separated list

### Skill Matching Priority
1. Skills explicitly listed as "required" in the JD — must appear
2. Skills listed as "preferred" or "nice to have" — include if truthful
3. Industry-standard tools related to the JD requirements — include for breadth
4. Transferable skills from adjacent domains — include if relevant

## Education

- Degree, field of study, institution name, graduation year
- List most recent degree first
- Include GPA only if above 3.5/4.0 and within the last 5 years
- Include relevant coursework only for recent graduates or career changers
- Relevant thesis or capstone projects can be mentioned briefly
- For experienced professionals (10+ years), keep this section minimal

## Certifications & Licenses

- Only include certifications relevant to the target role
- Include the full certification name, issuing body, and date obtained
- If the JD mentions specific certifications as required or preferred, ensure matching ones are prominent
- List in order of relevance to the JD, not chronologically

## Projects

- Include only if they demonstrate skills relevant to the JD
- Follow the same CAR format as work experience bullets
- Link to live projects or repositories if applicable and impressive
- 2-3 bullets per project maximum

## Volunteer Work & Extracurriculars

- Include only if relevant to the role or demonstrates leadership/values alignment
- Keep brief — 1-2 bullets per entry
- Useful for career changers to show relevant experience

## Languages

- List only if relevant to the role or company (global companies value multilingualism)
- Use standard proficiency levels: Native, Fluent, Professional Working Proficiency, Conversational, Basic
- Do NOT use vague terms like "good" or "intermediate"
