# Keyword Identification & Placement Strategy

How to extract, prioritize, and place keywords from a job description into a CV.

## Extracting Keywords from the Job Description

### Tier 1: Must-Have Keywords (Required Qualifications)
These appear in "required", "must have", "essential" sections of the JD. Missing these keywords often triggers automatic rejection.

- Specific job titles mentioned as requirements
- Years of experience thresholds
- Named technologies, tools, or platforms
- Required certifications or degrees
- Compliance or regulatory requirements (e.g., "HIPAA", "SOC 2", "GDPR")

### Tier 2: High-Value Keywords (Key Responsibilities)
These describe what the person will actually do. Matching these demonstrates role fit.

- Action verbs used to describe daily work
- Processes and methodologies (Agile, Scrum, Lean, Six Sigma)
- Deliverables mentioned (reports, dashboards, architectures)
- Scope indicators (cross-functional, global, enterprise-scale)

### Tier 3: Differentiator Keywords (Preferred Qualifications)
These separate competitive candidates from adequate ones.

- "Nice to have" skills and tools
- Industry experience or domain knowledge
- Advanced certifications beyond the minimum
- Leadership or mentorship experience
- Publications, patents, or speaking experience

### Tier 4: Culture & Values Keywords
These signal alignment with company values and team dynamics.

- Mission-related language
- Team descriptors (collaborative, autonomous, fast-paced)
- Soft skill emphasis (communication, adaptability, ownership)

## Keyword Placement Strategy

### Where to Place Keywords (Priority Order)

1. **Professional Summary** — Most heavily weighted by ATS and first thing humans read
   - Place 3-5 Tier 1 keywords here
   - Weave them into natural sentences

2. **Skills Section** — Direct keyword matching engine
   - All Tier 1 technical skills must appear here
   - Include Tier 2 and 3 skills that are truthful
   - Use exact JD phrasing

3. **Work Experience Bullets** — Contextual keyword placement
   - Distribute keywords across bullets to show they're backed by experience
   - Each Tier 1 keyword should appear in at least one experience bullet
   - Shows the keyword isn't just listed but actually used in practice

4. **Job Titles** — If truthful, align with JD terminology
   - If actual title was "Application Developer" and JD says "Software Engineer," use the actual title but consider adding the equivalent in parentheses if company policy allows

5. **Education & Certifications** — Keyword matching for credentials
   - Spell out degree names fully
   - Include relevant coursework that matches JD skills (for recent graduates)

### Keyword Density Guidelines

- **Natural integration**: Every keyword should appear in a grammatically correct, meaningful sentence
- **Repetition**: Important keywords can appear 2-3 times across different sections (summary, skills, experience) without seeming forced
- **Variation**: Use synonyms and related terms alongside exact matches
  - "project management" + "managing projects" + "led project teams"
  - "data analysis" + "analyzed data" + "data-driven insights"
- **Avoid keyword stuffing**: Never place keywords in hidden text, white-on-white, or in invisible sections. ATS systems detect and penalize this.

## Matching Technique: Mirror Phrasing

When the JD uses specific phrases, mirror them precisely:

| JD Says | Bad CV Version | Good CV Version |
|---------|----------------|-----------------|
| "cross-functional collaboration" | "worked with other teams" | "led cross-functional collaboration between engineering and product" |
| "data-driven decision making" | "used data to make choices" | "drove data-driven decision making that increased revenue by 15%" |
| "stakeholder management" | "talked to clients" | "managed stakeholder relationships across C-suite and external partners" |
| "continuous improvement" | "made things better" | "championed continuous improvement initiatives reducing defect rate by 30%" |

## Handling Keyword Gaps

When the CV doesn't contain experience matching a JD keyword:

1. **Check for equivalent experience** — The user may have the skill under a different name
   - JD says "CI/CD pipelines" → CV mentions "automated deployments" → reframe as CI/CD
2. **Check for transferable experience** — Adjacent skills that demonstrate capability
   - JD says "Kubernetes" → CV shows "Docker, container orchestration" → mention the Docker experience and container knowledge but do NOT claim Kubernetes experience
3. **Flag the gap** — If no honest bridge exists, flag it for the user
   - "The JD requires 5+ years of Java experience. Your CV shows 2 years. I've emphasized your Java work but recommend addressing this in a cover letter."

## Industry-Specific Keyword Patterns

### Technology
- Framework names + versions (React 18, .NET 6, Spring Boot 3)
- Cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP) + specific services (Lambda, EC2, S3)
- Database types (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis) + ORMs
- DevOps tools (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, Terraform, Ansible)

### Finance
- Regulatory frameworks (Basel III, SOX, MiFID II)
- Financial instruments (derivatives, equities, fixed income)
- Software (Bloomberg Terminal, SAP, Oracle Financials)
- Methodologies (risk modeling, financial forecasting, due diligence)

### Healthcare
- Compliance (HIPAA, FDA, GxP, ICD-10)
- Systems (Epic, Cerner, MEDITECH)
- Methodologies (clinical trials, patient safety, evidence-based practice)

### Marketing
- Platforms (Google Analytics, HubSpot, Salesforce, Marketo)
- Channels (SEO, SEM, social media, content marketing, email marketing)
- Metrics (CAC, LTV, ROAS, conversion rate, engagement rate)
- Methodologies (A/B testing, growth hacking, demand generation)

### General Management
- Methodologies (OKR, KPI, balanced scorecard, strategic planning)
- Scope (P&L ownership, budget management, headcount planning)
- Actions (restructuring, change management, digital transformation)
